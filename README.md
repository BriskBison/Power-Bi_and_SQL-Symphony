I AM STILL WORKING ON THIS PROJECT, IT IS NOT FULLY FINISHED YET :)

Hello,

in this work I present several dashboards in the Power Bi program and queries in the MS SQL Server program.

Each dashboard is contained in a separate chapter, to which the appropriate folder is assigned. Of course, you can download the Power Bi file from there, the .xlsx file ready to open in Excel, the file in the .csv form to upload it to SQL and screenshots of the dashboard and search results in the MS SQL Server program.

Below is a short table of contents with links to each chapter, and then there is my actual work - screenshots of dashboards, screenshots of SQL results and my explanations.

---

1. Chapter 1 - Dashboard, SQL (ALTER TABLE, SUM, COUNT, SUBQUERY, GROUP BY, HAVING)
2. Chapter 2 - Dashboard, SQL (FORMAT, ROUND, AVG, OVER, RANK, PARTITION BY, WHERE)
